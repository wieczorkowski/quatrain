QUATRAIN CHARTING CLIENT - LAUNCHER INSTRUCTIONS

========================================================
Desktop Shortcuts (Recommended for Testers)
========================================================

You should now have TWO shortcuts on your desktop:

ðŸš€ "Launch Quatrain" 
   - Use this for: First time launch or after code changes
   - What it does: Builds the application and then launches it
   - Takes longer but ensures you have the latest version

âš¡ "Restart Quatrain"
   - Use this for: Quick restart after Quatrain crashes
   - What it does: Launches using existing build (much faster)
   - Use this when Quatrain crashes and you want to get back quickly

========================================================
Manual Launch (If shortcuts don't work)
========================================================

If the desktop shortcuts don't work, you can run these files directly
from the Quatrain folder:

1. Double-click "Launch Quatrain.bat" (full build + launch)
2. Double-click "Restart Quatrain.bat" (quick restart)

========================================================
Troubleshooting
========================================================

â€¢ If Quatrain crashes: Use "Restart Quatrain" (faster)
â€¢ If you get errors or old version: Use "Launch Quatrain" (rebuilds)
â€¢ If nothing works: Contact Mark for assistance
â€¢ Console windows will appear briefly - this is normal

========================================================
What the Console Windows Show
========================================================

When you launch Quatrain, you'll see a console window with:
- "Building and launching Quatrain..." (for Launch)
- "Restarting Quatrain..." (for Restart)
- The window will stay open until Quatrain fully loads
- You can safely close the console window once Quatrain opens
