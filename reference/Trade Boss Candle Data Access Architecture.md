# Trade Boss Candle Data Access Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed architecture for enabling Trade Boss functionality in Quatrain to access and analyze candle chart data from the main charting component. Currently, Trade Boss only uses static point-based calculations from fill prices. The proposed enhancement will enable intelligent order placement based on actual chart analysis including support/resistance levels, trend analysis, and technical indicators.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Trade Boss Implementation

**Current Architecture:**
- **TradeWindow.js**: Contains Trade Boss UI in a separate Electron window
- **useTradeBoss.js**: Custom hook managing Trade Boss state and order handling
- **TradeBossLogic.js**: Business logic for order validation, automation, and tracking
- **TradeBossPanel.js**: UI component for Trade Boss interface

**Current Data Access:**
- ✅ Has DataClient instance for market data (symbol, price)
- ✅ Can access account information via Shared Data Service
- ❌ **NO access to candle data for chart analysis**
- ❌ **NO technical analysis capabilities**
- ❌ **NO dynamic order placement based on chart patterns**

**Current Order Logic:**
- Stop loss: `fillPrice ± stopLossPoints` (static)
- Scale out: `fillPrice ± (scaleOutPoints * orderCount)` (static)
- No consideration of support/resistance, trend direction, or chart patterns

### Available Data Infrastructure

**Quatrain Shared Data Service:**
- ✅ Centralized data store in main process
- ✅ Candle data available via channels: `candles:<instrument>:<timeframe>`
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions and historical data requests
- ✅ Multiple timeframes: 1m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, 1h
- ✅ OHLCV data format with timestamps

**Main Charting Component:**
- ✅ Receives live candle data from Chronicle server
- ✅ Pushes data to Shared Data Service via DataClient
- ✅ Manages multiple timeframes and instruments
- ✅ Has annotation system for technical analysis

## Proposed Architecture

### Phase 1: Basic Candle Data Access

#### 1.1 Trade Boss Candle Data Service

**New Component: `TradeBossCandleService.js`**

```javascript
// Location: src/components/trading/TradeBossCandleService.js
class TradeBossCandleService {
  constructor(dataClient) {
    this.dataClient = dataClient;
    this.candleSubscriptions = new Map();
    this.candleCache = new Map();
  }

  // Subscribe to candle data for multiple timeframes
  subscribeToCandles(instrument, timeframes = ['1m', '5m', '15m']);
  
  // Get historical candles for analysis
  getHistoricalCandles(instrument, timeframe, lookbackPeriods);
  
  // Analyze recent candles for support/resistance
  findSupportResistanceLevels(instrument, timeframe, lookbackPeriods);
  
  // Determine trend direction
  analyzeTrend(instrument, timeframe, lookbackPeriods);
  
  // Calculate dynamic stop loss based on chart patterns
  calculateIntelligentStopLoss(instrument, timeframe, entryPrice, direction);
  
  // Calculate dynamic scale-out levels based on technical levels
  calculateIntelligentScaleOut(instrument, timeframe, entryPrice, direction);
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Trade Boss Logic

**Modifications to `TradeBossLogic.js`:**

- Add candle service integration to `executeTradeBossAutomation()`
- Implement intelligent price calculation functions
- Add fallback to current static calculations if candle analysis fails
- Enhance validation to include candle data availability

#### 1.3 Trade Boss Hook Enhancement

**Modifications to `useTradeBoss.js`:**

- Initialize candle service with existing DataClient
- Add candle data state management
- Implement candle subscription lifecycle
- Add error handling for candle data access failures

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis Integration

#### 2.1 Technical Analysis Engine

**New Component: `TradeBossTechnicalAnalysis.js`**

```javascript
// Technical analysis functions for Trade Boss
class TradeBossTechnicalAnalysis {
  // Moving averages for trend confirmation
  calculateMovingAverages(candles, periods = [20, 50, 200]);
  
  // Support and resistance identification
  identifyKeyLevels(candles, lookbackPeriods = 50);
  
  // Fibonacci retracement levels
  calculateFibonacciLevels(candles, swingHigh, swingLow);
  
  // ATR for dynamic stop loss sizing
  calculateATR(candles, period = 14);
  
  // Volume analysis for confirmation
  analyzeVolumeProfile(candles, lookbackPeriods = 20);
  
  // Candlestick pattern recognition
  identifyPivotHighsLows(candles, leftBars = 5, rightBars = 5);
}
```

#### 2.2 Intelligent Order Placement Algorithms

**Enhanced calculation methods:**

1. **Dynamic Stop Loss:**
   - ATR-based stops (e.g., 2x ATR below entry)
   - Support/resistance level stops
   - Previous swing high/low stops
   - Trend-adjusted stops

2. **Intelligent Scale-Out Levels:**
   - Fibonacci extension levels
   - Previous resistance turned support
   - Round number levels (psychological levels)
   - Volume profile POC (Point of Control) levels

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Position sizing based on volatility (ATR)
   - Maximum risk per trade calculations
   - Correlation analysis across timeframes

### Phase 3: Multi-Timeframe Analysis

#### 3.1 Timeframe Coordination

**Multi-timeframe analysis workflow:**

1. **Higher Timeframe Bias (1h, 30m):**
   - Determine overall trend direction
   - Identify major support/resistance zones
   - Confirm trade direction alignment

2. **Entry Timeframe (5m, 1m):**
   - Precise entry point identification
   - Short-term pattern confirmation
   - Immediate stop loss placement

3. **Exit Management (1m, 5m):**
   - Real-time price action monitoring
   - Dynamic stop adjustment
   - Scale-out level adjustments

#### 3.2 Real-time Monitoring System

**Continuous candle analysis for active trades:**

- Monitor price action relative to key levels
- Adjust stops based on new support/resistance
- Modify scale-out targets based on momentum
- Alert system for significant pattern changes

## Data Flow Architecture

### Current Data Flow
```
Chronicle Server → Main Quatrain Window → Shared Data Service → Trade Window (Market Data Only)
```

### Proposed Data Flow
```
Chronicle Server → Main Quatrain Window → Shared Data Service → Trade Window
                                      ↓
                     TradeBossCandleService ← TradeBossTechnicalAnalysis
                                      ↓
                     IntelligentOrderPlacement → NinjaTrader Bridge
```

### Candle Data Subscription Pattern

**Multi-timeframe subscription:**
```javascript
// Subscribe to multiple timeframes for comprehensive analysis
const timeframes = ['1m', '5m', '15m', '30m', '1h'];
timeframes.forEach(tf => {
  candleService.subscribeToCandles(currentInstrument, tf, (candles) => {
    technicalAnalysis.updateAnalysis(tf, candles);
    orderPlacement.recalculateTargets(tf, candles);
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Candle Cache Limits**: Store only necessary historical data (e.g., 200 candles per timeframe)
- **Subscription Management**: Unsubscribe from unused timeframes
- **Analysis Throttling**: Limit technical analysis frequency to prevent CPU overhead

### Real-time Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Load historical candles only when Trade Boss is active
- **Incremental Analysis**: Update analysis only on new candles, not every tick
- **Background Processing**: Run heavy calculations in web workers if needed

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to static calculations if candle data unavailable
- **Connection Resilience**: Handle Shared Data Service disconnections
- **Analysis Validation**: Verify technical analysis results before order placement

## Security and Risk Management

### Data Validation
- **Candle Data Integrity**: Validate OHLCV data before analysis
- **Analysis Bounds Checking**: Ensure calculated levels are reasonable
- **Order Size Limits**: Implement maximum position size safeguards

### Trade Safety
- **Manual Override**: Always allow user to override calculated levels
- **Emergency Stops**: Implement circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
- **Analysis Confidence**: Show confidence levels for all calculations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual technical analysis functions
- Validate candle data processing
- Verify order calculation algorithms

### Integration Testing
- Test Shared Data Service integration
- Validate multi-timeframe coordination
- Test error handling and fallback scenarios

### Backtesting Framework
- Historical data replay for algorithm validation
- Performance metrics calculation
- Risk-adjusted return analysis

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals (Phase 1)
- ✅ Trade Boss can access candle data from all timeframes
- ✅ Basic support/resistance calculation functional
- ✅ ATR-based stop loss placement working
- ✅ No performance degradation in Trade Window
